        <h1 style="background-color:rgb(167, 139, 62);"style="font-size:60px;">Favorite Places I've been to</h1>
        <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 110, 77);">These are the list of my favorite places that I've been through before and why is it that it is my 
            favorite place despite others.</p>
            <h1 style="background-color:rgb(124, 114, 91);"style="font-size:45px;">List of my Favorite Places</h1>
            <ol  type= 'I'>
                <li><em>Oling, Dalupirip Itogon Benguet (Home)</em></li>
                <li><em>La Trinidad</em></li>
                <li><em>Sabangan, Mountain province</em></li>
                <li><em>Baguio City</em></li>
            </ol>   
            <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 110, 77);"style="font-size:25px;">Why is it that my number one favorite is my hometown, obviously I was born there and I miss Home.
            In addition I love how unspoil our province is and how quite and lovely is to live far from the civilization,
            where I can enjoy the quite atmosphere, fresh air, fresh foods, no need to buy anything for everydy use,
            plenty of fruits and vegetables that I can get from our backyard and how I miss picking mushrooms in  the,
            wilderness where I can gather many and share it with my family and other relative. I miss being in the mountain and out of stress,
            It is my relaxation.</p>

    <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 110, 77);">La trinidad to me is like a second home, this is where me and my brothers and sisters study and is staying.
            we live here for the sake of our parents desire for us to finish our studies, and to achieve our dreams. I always wanted to come here when I was little,
            maybe beacuse I was wondering why mym brothers and sisters never go home fro a very longtime and they would only come home if it is,
            christmas and new year that's when I can only see them. But now that I am here I now understand how education is,
            impotant in our lives.</p>
    </article>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 110, 77);">I stayed in sabangan for about 2 years and I also studied there, and the people there are very nice, humble and very ambitious i would say.
            Many of them usually are very healthy and they are good in one or other things and I am amazed how people in here,
            interact with each other. The way they celebrate, the way how enjoyable their fiesta is, the way they welcome yoy, even if you are
            not one of them and I know that this is the trait that most Cordillera people are.</p>
    </article>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(104, 110, 77);">In Baguio City I have fun memories about the epic fails of my parents and my brothers, upon the first encounter or coming,
            here in baguio how my brother removed his slipper when entering the jeep, how my father answered my older brother's question about how to read "Bakery Sho" and he told him,
            it is read as backeshap, and how my sister is always so very nusea when riding a trip from our village to here. It is like a part of Baguio City is,
            every indigenous people make funny decisions and reaction and that's where you still can see how other people is liing in 20th century.</p>
