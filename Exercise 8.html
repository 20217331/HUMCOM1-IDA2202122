  Hiccup (Donald Reignoux) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons are a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Emmanuel Jacomy) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking. When he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

  Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) arrives at Port Royal in the Caribbean without a ship or crew. His timing is inopportune, however, because later that evening the town is besieged by a pirate ship. The pirates kidnap the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who's in possession of a valuable coin that is linked to a curse that has transformed the pirates into the undead. A gallant blacksmith (Orlando Bloom) in love with Elizabeth allies with Sparrow in pursuit of the pirates.

She fights with her father whom she addresses as Commander and his pupils to catch hold of bandits, money mongers, and other antisocial elements. She is nicknamed 'The Jackal' for she's shrewd and clever beyond her years. In time she works for the King- Wang Yoo, gaining his trust and admiration for her archery skills. She plays an important role in protecting Toghon Temur, the crown prince of the Mongol Empire who is sent to Goryeo in exile, whom his own countrymen conspire to kill under the orders of the Regent, El Temur.
  Somewhere in between, her identity as a girl is revealed. The King of Goryeo is deported to Yuan, and she is taken as a concubine. With several turn of events she rises to the position of a palace servant, a court lady, King's consort, and finally the empress; gaining many friends and enemies in the journey, losing many near and dear ones to power plays, scheming her own revenge, escaping death numerous times and influencing Goryeo and Yuan's economy and polity in a major way
