    <p style="color:rgb(248, 35, 46);"> <i> <b>While continuing on their quest for the storied Sword of Cortés, the crew suddenly finds itself entranced by an ethereal song.</b>
    <p style="color:rgb(231, 14, 32);"> <i> <b>As a result, each of them attempts to take the Barnacle in a different direction—and away from the Sword’s supposed location.</b>
    <p style="color:rgb(231, 14, 14);"> <i> <b>Ghostly sound begins to emanate from the sea, captivating everyone aboard the ship Only Jack seems unaffected by the strange song.</b>
    <p style="color:rgb(233, 15, 15);"> <i> <b>Jack comes to realize that the thing he values most in the world is his freedom, meaning he is now bound to ultimately give up his liberty to the mermaids once he finds the Sword.
    <p style="color:rgb(233, 15, 15);"> <i> <b>Jack manages to assuage himself that once they find the Sword, he will be able to get out of his deal with the mermaids, as "Captain Jack Sparrow can find his way out of any mess".</b>
